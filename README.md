# IPZ_Case_for_photovoltaics_with_sensors

The task to be done is a device that will prevent fires in photovoltaic installations. In today's world, when renewable energy sources, including photovoltaic installations, are becoming very popular, it is very important to ensure that they are as safe as possible.

The device that will be developed is a housing/cover for the M C4 connector, in which smoke and thermocouple sensors will be mounted. These sensors, upon exceeding the set threshold, will disconnect the entire installation. The whole system will be based on ARDUINO software.
